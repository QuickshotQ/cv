  <p> I am currently a design engineer at T-Mobile. For the two years here at T-Mobile I've worked with 5G testing/validation, testing hardware for market deploment and many other important projects.
    While working with hardware I also wanted to get familiar with the software side of things so I started learning HTML, CSS and Java on my own free time. This site you are currently on was created option
    was created using purely HTML, it was one of my first projects.
    When I am not working I love playing basketball, some people tell me I'm a great three point shooter. I also play Fifa competitively. </p>
  <br>
  <p>One of my many passions includes trading stocks. I am the founder of <a href="https://discord.com/invite/k2dFuKypsT"><strong>Stock Overflow</strong></a>, a growing community of over 2,000 members that I mentor. </p>
